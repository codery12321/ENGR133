README for navigation purposes. 

This repository includes materials I've written during Fall2020 semester and the summer before that (Ind Proj). The commit dates are not accurate because I learned how Github works in 2021 when taking ECE264. I then decided to upload my old files on to Github so all of my works could be organized in one place. 

- EXCEL includes basic excel assignments during FALL 2020 ENGR 133 class.

- MATLAB includes basic MATLAB assignments during FALL 2020 ENGR 133 class.

- PYTHON includes basic Python assignments during FALL 2020 ENGR 133 class.

- FA20 Ind Proj includes a project I've did during the summer of 2020 while in Covid lockdown.
