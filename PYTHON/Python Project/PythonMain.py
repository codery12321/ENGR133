Assignment Information
	Assignment:     e.g. Py1 Task 1
	Author:         Jonathan Budiman, jbudiman@purdue.edu
	Team ID:        LC1-15
	
Contributors:   Yolanda Chen, chen2633@purdue

	My contributor(s) helped me:	
	[X] understand the assignment expectations without
		telling me how they will approach it.
	[X] understand different ways to think about a solution
		without helping me plan my solution.
	[X] think through the meaning of a specific error or
		bug present in my code without looking at my code.
	Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
	have to list that person as a contributor here as well.
